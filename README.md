## ESLint

This project is `eslint-config-standard` as another ESLint configuration for consistent code styling, as the default Next configuration doesnâ€™t do much to help improve the quality of the codebase.

There is `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` which handles the organization of our tailwind classnames logically. This makes the code easier to read and review.

Also, there is the `eslint-config-prettier` which removes all ESLint rules that could conflict with Prettier.

> NB: To test that prettier and eslint are working properly together, make sure to install ESLint and Prettier from the Extensions Marketplace
